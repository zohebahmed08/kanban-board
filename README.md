# Kanban Board

A basic online application for a kanban board that uses cards and was greatly influenced by Trello; it even has a lot of the same user interface. Up to 512 distinct kanban boards with various names that contain cards can be created. One can store an infinite amount of tasks or stuff on each card. Drag and drop is supported for all objects for both within and between cards for reordering. The browser saves all of the data locally on the machine. All of the project's code was written in HTML, CSS, and standard JavaScript without the need for any outside libraries.
